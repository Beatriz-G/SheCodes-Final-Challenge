            <h3>Creating Tasty Desserts</h3>
            <p>
                "Making dessert at home allows you to customize 
                <br>your desserts to your liking. You can adjust 
                <br>sweetness levels, use alternative sweeteners, 
                <br>flours, and oils to fit your dietary needs. 
                <br>This means you can make desserts that meet your 
                <br>preferences, dietary restrictions, and taste buds."

            <h3>Enhance your Creativity</h3>
            <p>
                "Baking is a great creative outlet, 
                <br>from experimenting with flavours, 
                <br>to creating unique cake designs. 
                <br>Creative activity has also been shown 
                <br>to have positive mental health benefits."

            <h3>Happiness and Desserts</h3>
            <p>
                "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell 
                <br>you we feel happier after treating ourselves 
                <br>to a tasty treat, but what's actually happening 
                <br>inside our brain when this occurs? Foods high in 
                <br>carbohydrates stimulate the release of serotonin, 
                <br>which acts as a hormone and helps promote feelings of happiness. 

                <br>When done in moderation, desserts can give you a 
                <br>positive boost that fruits, veggies and other foods 
                <br>can't always measure up to. And while it might seem 
                <br>a little counterproductive at first, enjoying a dessert 
                <br>once a week or so can help keep you on the right healthy eating track."
